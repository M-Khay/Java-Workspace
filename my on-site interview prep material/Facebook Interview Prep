1. Net Neutrality: 
	- I always wanted to know from a facebook employee, What is your defination of "Net Neutrality"? And is it in pure terms for the betterment of the society?

Points to take conversation forward.
	- Ive came across different people, who hold opposite opinions on it (Positive and Negative), and are very firm about it as well. Now both cant be right and and apperantely truth can only be explain in the hindsight.


2. Authenticity of the content on Facebook:
	- Is this a concern for Facebook

Mostly wont have to say this point  here, since it will be included in his answer.
	-  what steps Facebook plans to take towards it.

Points to take conversation forward: 
	 - I believe Facebook is a community of people.
	 - And it definately plays an important role in forming the society values we people live in, alongwith other social platform like Redit, Quora etc.
	 - Indeed it is very hard to identify what is fake news and what is not, but moreover one cannot simply restrict/stop people from posting content, it will be like putting restrictions on th First Amendment.

3. Virtual Reality: 
	- It is one the next big thing (just like I.O.T) that will make a mark in history. We have oftenuse the phrase "Its the next generation technology", this is one of those technology. 

	Why did smart phones that runs Android or Apple on them became such a huge success?
		- They introduced a new  way to manage and interact with data. Which was quicker, better, richer in properties then the existing solution and completely scalable.

		This was the the first reaction that casued the chain reaction to begin.

	Similarly I think its the right time to start introducing the real powers of VR and let the people slowly adapt the change. Its a new way to interact among us and hopefully in future it be the next way to interact with information around us.

4. Facebook News: 
Motivation : Google News, Yahoo News.

So when people like myself who are spending less time on facebook because Facebook for me is a platform where 
1. I have fun with friends especially old pals and ones who are distance away.
2. Or I come for stress buster ( With those pages like 9Gag and infinite more).
3. And earlier I use to find  game's and other apps interesting too but I grew over those way to quickly.

And we have already seen platforms such as RedIt, Quora, Twitter etc where people come to share information and generate more content.


Here is the interesting use case behind this is for Facebook: 

In general terms Majority of the users never ever visit  Facebook for learning news. They come to Facebook to prove their point which they have already firmly established in their heads through whatever sources, and since Facebook is powered by feeds which are catered to ones interest, likes and followins the user will not have the best
